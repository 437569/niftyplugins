	Adds some automation and IDE support for common perforce operations.
	
	
	This will a couple of commands to your command line, available under the namespace Aurora.NiftyPerforce.Connect. The only ones that you have to worry about are:
	
		Aurora.NiftyPerforce.Connect.Configuration - Brings up the configuration dialog.
		Aurora.NiftyPerforce.Connect.P4Edit - Checks the current document out for edit in perforce.
		
	
NiftySolution
	Adds a open files in solution dialog.

That's it for now.
