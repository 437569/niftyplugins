This is a small collection of C# plugins for Visual Studio 2005.

NiftyPerforce
	Adds some automation and IDE support for common perforce operations.
	
	
	This will a couple of commands to your command line, available under 
    the namespace Aurora.NiftyPerforce.Connect. The only ones that you 
    have to worry about are:
	
		Aurora.NiftyPerforce.Connect.Configuration - Brings up the configuration dialog.
		Aurora.NiftyPerforce.Connect.P4Edit - Checks the current document out for edit in perforce.
	
NiftySolution
	Adds a open files in solution dialog.
	Adds a toggle header/cpp file command.



Installation:

Simply unzip all the files to:

    My Documents\Visual Studio 2005\Addins

If you need the addins to be active across multiple versions of 
Visual Studio, simply unzip the files here instead:

    %APPDATA%\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins\

You might need to actually create the directory ...


That's it for now.
