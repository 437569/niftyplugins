[![Build](https://github.com/belkiss/niftyplugins/actions/workflows/build-and-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/belkiss/niftyplugins/actions/workflows/build-and-publish.yml)

The biggest changes from the original NiftyPerforce are:
  * support for recent Visual Studio versions, from vs2017 to vs2022
  * proper registration of NiftyPerforce in the UI, so it can be removed without leaving anything behind
  * CI using GithubActions
